#Data_Analyst_Udacity_Project 1
Examine the No Show Appointments dataset.

The Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program has three completed projects, the first of which is this one. This is not intended to be an in-depth analysis of the dataset, but rather an example of using Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, and conveying results at a basic level.

I decided to examine the "No-show appointments" dataset out of the three that Udacity had made accessible since I thought it would include the least industry-specific terminology.
